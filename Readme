Hello,

This document describes the material of our paper submitted for ESWC2020 to validate and reproduce the results.

1. The file "UEQ_Data_Analysis_Tool_V" reports the results (please see sheet "results" of User Experience Questionnaire using our tool.

2. The file "Triple-votes-groungtruth-OpenIE" reports the results of our tool in terms of quality.
- The sheet "vote-data" presents the results of the triples extracted using our tool and the voting by other players
- The sheet "Expert Benchmark" presents the ground truth of the extracted triples
- The sheet "OpenIE=1" presents the results of the triples extracted using OpenIE for confidence = 1
- The sheet "OpenIE<1" presents the results of the triples extracted using OpenIE for confidence < 1

3. The file "UserTestReport" reports the results of the semi-structured interview.

4. Tool-master is the code of our tool, code is also available on Github at https://github.com/devbas/Treption
 The tool has been developed using python and javascript. 
 To enable triple storage, we used Apache Jena Fuseki and MySQL for datastore (voting, nouns, verbs). 
 For natural language processing we used stanford-corenlp. 
 Finally, we packaged our tool using Docker, so it can be easy to use. 
 The current version of the tool is standalone however, with docker we can deployed on a crowdsourcing platform such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.
